# GitHub Copilot Instructions

**Audience:** GitHub Copilot only. This file provides Copilot-specific instructions and configuration for this repository.

**Repository Context:**
This repository is a GitHub Template created by Capgemini's AI & Software Engineering Experts. It contains practical, portable, and useful examples of Copilot configuration for real-world projects.

**Copilot Guidance:**
- Follow the configuration and best practices outlined here when assisting in this repository.
- Reference `README.md` for general orientation and project goals.
- Reference `AGENTS.md` for broader AI agent instructions and context.


**.github Directory Structure & Purpose:**

The `.github` directory contains several subdirectories and files that organize configuration, prompts, and instructions for Copilot and other AI agents:

- `chatmodes/`: Contains chat mode configuration files (e.g., `custom-mode.chatmode.md`) that define custom conversational behaviors for Copilot and other agents.
- `instructions/`: Holds instruction files for backend, frontend, and documentation. These guide Copilot and other agents on best practices and project-specific rules.
- `prompts/`: Includes prompt templates (e.g., `write-adr.prompt.md`, `write-docs.prompt.md`, `write-prd.prompt.md`) used to generate architectural decision records, documentation, and product requirements. These help standardize and accelerate content creation.
- `workflows/`: Intended for GitHub Actions workflow files, which automate CI/CD and other repository tasks. (Currently empty, but will be expanded.)

Refer to the main README.md for a full overview of repository goals and usage.
