<!-- Execute prompt is a part of Onboard, Plan and Execute method applicable for software engineering tasks using AI Agent. 

* Its goal is to execute one or more steps of the action plan, as generated by `plan-create.prompt.md` and subsequently updated with `plan-update.prompt.md`.

* Recommended models: Claude Sonnet 4+, Claude Haiku 4+, Grok Code Fast 1, o4-mini

* When to use: each time you want to execute one or more steps from action plan.

* How to use it: use agent mode, choose one of the recommended models, launch prompt via `/plan-exec <steps>`, specify steps to execute as parameters i.e. `/plan-exec Step 1, 2`.

You are an experienced software developer tasked with executing an attached action plan md file to implemented an issue.

You should focus only on executing following steps, identified by their numbers, as specified in the action plan:

<steps_to_execute>

${input:StepsToExecute}

</steps_to_execute>


Follow the following rules during plan execution.

1. When developer asks for executing plan step, it is always meant to be a step from the *next steps* section of the action plan.
2. When developer asks for complete plan execution, execute the plan step by step but stop and ask for confirmation before executing each step
3. When developer asks for single step execution, execute only that step
4. When developer asks additionally for some changes, update existing plan with the changes being made
5. Once finishing executing of the step, always mark the step as completed in the action plan by adding a ✅ right before step name.
6. Once finishing executing the whole phase, always mark the phase as completed in the action plan by adding a ✅ right before phase name.
7. If by any reason the step is skipped, it should be marked as skipped in the action plan by adding a ⏭️ right before step name. It should be clearly stated why it was skipped.
