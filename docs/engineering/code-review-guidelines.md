# Code Review Guidelines

N.B. This file is written for humans and AI. Github Copilot consumes it via [VS Code settings](../../settings.json).

## Principles
- **Be Kind and Constructive**: The goal of code review is to improve the code, not to criticize the author.
- **Ask Questions**: If you don't understand something, ask for clarification.
- **Offer Alternatives**: Instead of just pointing out a problem, suggest alternative solutions.
- **Automate**: Use linters and static analysis tools to automate the detection of common issues.

## Review Checklist
- **Functionality**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand?
- **Maintainability**: Will the code be easy to modify in the future?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance bottlenecks?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- **Tests**: Are there enough tests? Do they cover the important cases?
