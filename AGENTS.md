# AGENTS

This file provides general instructions and context for all AI agents working in this repository (not just Copilot).

**Repository Overview:**
- This is a GitHub Template created by Capgemini's AI & Software Engineering experts.
- It contains practical examples of Copilot and agent configuration, plus educational resources.

**For AI Agents:**
- Use this file to understand the project’s goals, structure, and best practices.
- Reference configuration and documentation files for deeper context.
- For Copilot-specific instructions, see `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Other AI Agents should consider `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as informative, but not supersede their own custom instruction files, if present.
- It's critical to stop and alert the user if an AI finds conflicting instructions.

**Repository Structure for Docs and Plans:**
- Documentation is stored in the `docs/` directory. This includes general documentation, architectural decision records (ADRs), and product requirements documents (PRDs).
- Project plans and related planning materials are stored only in the `plans/` directory.
- Strictly follow the instructions on plan creation and management that are found in the `plans/README.md`.
- Agent todo items MUST be maintained as a Markdown checkbox list only in `plans/TODO.md`, not in any other agent-specific file.
- Source code will be stored in the `src` directory.

**For Humans:**
- See [the main project README](./README.md) for a general project overview and orientation.

This file may repeat some context from other docs to ensure agents have the information they need.
